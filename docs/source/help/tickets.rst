:bluelight:`Introduction`
-------------------------

The resources at RCIC are here to help the UCI research community.
There are 1000's of accounts on our resources, representing
disciplines from every corner of UCI.

We handle a lot of help requests and the :tt:`underline time to understand your problem is at a premium`.
Please remember:

* The better you construct our request the faster we can get to solving it.
* Requests donâ€™t need to be elaborate, but
  how you submit your ticket and what information you include can
  greatly speed up resolution and save time for you and for us to hone in on
  the root cause.
* If we don't have relevant information or we cannot reproduce your problem, we cannot fix it!

A pretty good perspective on `How to report bugs effectively
<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>`_
illustrates some of the reasons for the detail.  High-end computing is a team sport!

**Please follow the guidelines below when submitting help requests**.

.. _submit ticket:

:bluelight:`How to submit`
--------------------------

* Send email to hpc-support@uci.edu describing your problem, this
  will automatically generate a ticket in our tracking system.
* After you submit a ticket there is an :underline:`automated email response`
  that it was registered in our system.
* This will be followed by a :underline:`real response` from one of our team
  members who is handling the ticket.

  .. note:: | We try to respond by the next business day, but we do not work 24x7.
            | Only emergency tickets are answered on weekends or during the holidays.

.. _good ticket:

:bluelight:`Good ticket practices`
-----------------------------------

:underline:`Before submitting a ticket`
  Help yourself first. Try your best to see if the problem is a simple one.

  1. **Assume you did something wrong**. Verify your commands and scripts and try to reproduce the error.
     Sometimes simple typos or wrong parameters are a cause of a problem.
  2. **Examine the contents of output/error files** (if your programs have any) before you call for help.
     Often these files have additional information and even potential solutions.
  3. **Read our** :ref:`faq`. Your question may have already been answered.
  4. **Read our user guides**. They explain a few guidelines that are specific for our systems.
     When users follow our guidelines many of the problems are easily avoided, such as:

     * file permissions
     * quota problems
     * Slurm jobs submission errors and OOM killed errors

  5. **Do a Google search** with your error message. Others may have had the same
     problem  and found a successful solution. Note, you need to understand
     what in your error is general (applicable to other similar
     installations) and what is specific to the resources we provide.

:underline:`While submitting a ticket`

:DO:
  * Please try to submit using your :underline:`@uci.edu` email address.
  * For any problem always provide your UCInetID.
  * Have a descriptive subject line.
  * Be specific and provide only relevant essential factual information
    about a problem (see following sections for details).
    **Simple text-based cut and paste directly into your email is the best info we can use**.
    Usually there are just a few lines.
  * Be reasonable and polite. We know when something goes wrong, it's very stressful. It's stressful for us, too.

:DO NOT:
  * :red:`Do not be vague`. Statements like *it's slow*, *I can't login*, or *my code doesn't work* give us nothing concrete.
  * :red:`Do not send screenshots` unless you are working with a graphics application
    and the problem can not be described without a screenshot.
    From screenshots, we can't cut and paste commands or other info, which
    slows down our resolution of your problem.
  * :red:`Do not attach multiple files` to your ticket. This can overload mail attachment limit
    in ticketing system. It is much easier for us to see all files if you simply provide full path to them
    in your storage area.
  * :red:`Do not send multiple ticket requests` for the same problem. Simply reply to
    our response to you, this will keep all email conversation on the same ticket and same email thread.

:underline:`After receiving a response from us`
  1. Sometimes our response is *no, this can't be done* or similar.
     This is a specific resolution of a specific ticket.
     There is always a :underline:`reasonable cause` for this and we explain it in our response.
  2. When we ask for additional information in our response provide exactly what we ask.
  3. Once your problem is resolved, acknowledge this so we can close the ticket.

.. _login tickets:

:bluelight:`Login problems`
---------------------------

When reporting login problems please include the following:

* Where from are you trying to log in, from campus or over the VPN ?
* What computer and Operating System (Windows, macOS, Linux) are you connecting from ?
* What software and what version are you using to connect ?
* Copy and paste into your email:

    * **exact commands** you typed
    * **exact errors** you saw

.. _software tickets:

:bluelight:`Software Problems`
------------------------------

When reporting software problems, please include the following:

* Slurm job ID If this error was related to your software use in the Slurm job,
* Your working directory  (output of ``pwd`` command).
* If you loaded software modules, what were they (output of ``module list`` command)?
* Copy and paste into your email:

    * **exact commands** you typed
    * **exact errors** you saw

  If the error and output are more than a few lines long, save in separate files and provide full paths to them.
* Break very long commands into readable length with the use of the :red:`\\`
  (back slash continuation character).

  For example, this long line is difficult to read:

  .. code-block:: console

                  make_2d_plots.py -i wetdry_cr/beta_diveuclidean/beta_div_euclideancoords.txt -m wetdry_cr/mapping_files/merged_mapping_data.txt -b 'Elevation' -o wetdry_cr/2dplots/elevation

  Same line with added :red:`\\` is much easier to read and to understand:

  .. code-block:: console

                  make_2d_plots.py \
                    -i wetdry_cr/beta_diveuclidean/beta_div_euclideancoords.txt \
                    -m wetdry_cr/mapping_files/merged_mapping_data.txt \
                    -b 'Elevation' \
                    -o wetdry_cr/2dplots/elevation

.. _slurm tickets:

:bluelight:`Slurm Problems`
---------------------------

When reporting Slurm problems, please include the following:

* Slurm job ID.
* Your working directory  (output of ``pwd`` command).
* Copy and paste into your email:

    * **exact commands** you typed
    * **exact errors** you saw
* Node  where you see the issue (for interactive jobs it is output of ``hostname`` command).
* Full path to the files that you reference (Slurm submit script,
  output/input/error files, your own scripts, etc).
* If you are asking to be added to PI's CPU or GPU Slurm lab account:

  * account type (CPU or GPU)
  * your PI UCInetID
  * | :underline:`cc your request` to your PI so the PI can confirm the access on the same ticket.
    | **We can't grant any access without PI's confirmation.**

.. _storage tickets:

:bluelight:`Storage Problems`
-----------------------------

When reporting problems related to DFS or CRSP storage or quotas
please include the following:

* DFS or CRSP path and group ID you are trying to access. Many groups have
  multiple paths, we can't guess from your name which one you need.
* How do you access storage: while logged in on HPC3, via web browser, CRSP Desktop, etc.
* Copy and paste into your email **exact commands** you typed and **exact errors** you saw.
* If you are asking to be added to PI's DFS or CRSP group:

  * your PI UCInetID
  * | :underline:`cc your request` to your PI so the PI can confirm the access on the same ticket.
    | **We can't grant any access without PI's confirmation.**

.. _software install tickets:

:bluelight:`Requesting New software`
------------------------------------

Because this is a research environment, we are often asked to add new software.
RCIC builds and maintains an extensive collection of domain-specific software.
We do our best to balance stability with the availability of *latest and greatest*.

Some software is very straightforward to build and deploy to the cluster,
other software can be extremely challenging and time consuming.

Given realities of time:
  * :underline:`We have to prioritize software that affects more than a single
    researcher or group`.
  * :red:`We certainly are NOT here to install software that`

      * You might use.
      * You just want to play with or evaluate.
      * Is too new:

          * a Beta version.
          * the latest available version. Just because it is the latest is not a good reason.
      * Is too old:

          * Anything that is 5 or more years old is not a good candidate.
          * Is no longer supported by developers (Python 2).

Even with those constraints, we are not shy about taking on complicated,
time-consuming installs with many dependencies.  Part of our value add to UCI is to handle as much of this as
possible.  We strive to say "yes" to software requests, but sometimes do have to say "no."

:underline:`Before asking us to install`:

  * Check if the software is already installed on the cluster.
    See :ref:`list modules <list modules>` for details.
  * Install it yourself. We encourage users first to build/install the applications
    in their user area. Please see the guides in :ref:`user installed`.

      * Most R, Python and Perl packages can be :ref:`installed on a per-user basis <user installed>`.
      * | :red:`All conda packages and environments must be installed by the users themselves`.
        | You do not need to install Miniconda, Anaconda or Mamba.
          We provide a few basic versions that can be accessed via modules and used
          to :ref:`install your desired packages or environments <user installed>`.

  .. attention::
      * Please note HPC3 is **CentOS-based system**.
        When you attempt to install yourself, and you run across instructions that say :tt:`Ubuntu`
        or :tt:`apt get` or similar, those are for a different Linux-based OS and won't work on HPC3.
      * **For security reasons the following is not allowed**:
          - :red:`sudo  or su access`
          - :red:`Docker`

        However, many docker containers can be reused as :ref:`Singularity containers <install singularity>`.

:underline:`Submit a Software Ticket`

  You might not be able to install/compile the software yourself without some additional
  system-installed software and that's a good reason to ask us.

  :red:`IMPORTANT` RCIC may say "no" to your software request. We simply do not have the staff time to
  install every requested software component. We prioritize software that has wide applicability.  Applications
  that you want to "evaluate" are seldom (if ever) installed by RCIC.

  In the end, it's a partnership to get new software added to HPC3. We need good
  information from you and a willingness to validate the installed software.


  If you want to request new software or updated versions of software that are
  already installed please submit a ticket with the following information:

  * A brief statement about which lab/domain the software will impact
    and why this specific version is needed.
    Don't write *many labs will use it*, we need factual usefulness info.
  * Software name and version.
  * URL for download/install instructions.
  * How have you tried to install it yourself, and what were **exact commands** and **exact errors**.
  * Any special configuration options and capabilities that should be enabled or disabled.
  * A brief statement about a "test" input and expected output so that we can do an initial validation.

.. _access licensed software:

:bluelight:`Access Licensed Software`
-------------------------------------

When requesting an access to the licensed software please include the following:

* your UCInetID
* your PI UCInetID
* :underline:`cc your request to your PI` so that the PI can 

  * confirm your  access (response comes on the same ticket)
  * provide a proof of the license purchase. 

  **We canâ€™t grant any access without PIâ€™s confirmation**.
