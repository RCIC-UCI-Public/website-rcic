Good support ticket
--------------------

If you use HPC3 long enough, you will need to submit a support ticket to us.
How you submit your ticket and the information you include can greatly speed up
resolution and save time for you and for us. The system is complex with many users,
simple requests don’t need to be elaborate, but when something is broken, good 
descriptions and information REALLY help us hone in on the root cause. 

.. admonition:: Remember!
  
   Please remember that if we cannot reproduce your problem, we cannot fix it!

HPC3 (specs, nodes/owners) is one of UCI’s shared-computing cluster that expands upon the condo-style model 
of GreenPlanet and the now-retired HPC clusters. Condo clusters have one model of expanding capacity — 
users purchase physical hardware. HPC3 supports expansion through hardware support but adds additional 
mechanisms to provide allocated capacity
