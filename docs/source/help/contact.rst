There are two major ways to ask for help on our resources.

:bluelight:`Submit support ticket`

   If you need help, please submit a support ticket via sending an email
   to hpc-support@uci.edu. Our team members will try to assist you.

   **The email must contain useful information** for us to help you. Please see :ref:`submit ticket`


:bluelight:`Ask the UCI Community`

   Every UCI user (except Health Sciences) has a google account.

   As part of the launch of HPC3, we added a **Google Groups discussion** list.
   If you subscribe to this list, you can ask questions of the greater UCI research community
   where there are many knowledgeable people who can help.

   | RCIC will also monitor and respond to posts in this discussion group.
   | Conversations are archived so that you can search previous posts.

   To subscribe:

   .. _subscribe google group:

   .. table::
      :class: noscroll-table
