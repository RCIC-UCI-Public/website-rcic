There are two major ways to ask for help on our resources.

Submit support ticket
---------------------

If you need help, please submit a **support ticket** via sending an email
to hpc-support@uci.edu. Our team members will try to assist you.

| The email must contain useful information for us to help you.
| Please see how to :ref:`submit ticket`


Ask the UCI Community
---------------------

As part of the launch of HPC3, we are adding a **Google Groups discussion** list.
If you subscribe to this list, you can ask questions of the greater UCI research community.

There are many knowledgeable people at UCI, they can help.  RCIC will also monitor and respond to posts
in this discussion group. Conversations are archived so that you can search previous posts.
