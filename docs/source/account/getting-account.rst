.. _closing account:

Closing an account
==================

For as long as you have a valid UCInetID and you use your account it remains active.
When you separate from UCI your UCInetID will become inactive some time after
the separation.

The accounts are closed when:

1. An account has no activity for 1 year.
2. Once your UCInetID loses student status.
   Most student alumni keep student status for up to 1 year after the graduation.
3. When your UCInetID loses staff/researcher/PI affiliation.
