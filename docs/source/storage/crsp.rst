CRSP 
=====

In general, users do not get a default CRSP allocation.
CRSP allocation is provided for UCI faculty members as follows.

UCI Faculty members can have two types of allocations

1. No cost baseline allocation: 1TB per researcher

   CRSP is funded through central campus to guarantee a fixed amount of no-cost storage to any faculty member
   or staff researcher who requests space. These campus funds pay for the people, the baseline infrastructure,
   and vendor maintenance required to provide the robust infrastructure.

2. Recharge allocation: recharge rate is $60/TB/year, please see price

   Researchers who require more capacity than the baseline allocation, can purchase additional capacity,
   billed annually via campus recharge. The recharge is computed on the basis of recovering the cost 
   of additional space. 


.. note:: The allocation owners can grant access to their spaces to students, postdocs, and other faculty members.
