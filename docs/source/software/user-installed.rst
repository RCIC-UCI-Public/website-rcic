User installed software
=======================

Users often ask to add packages to 
:tt:`Python` / :tt:`R` / :tt:`Perl` / :tt:`conda` / :tt:`miniconda` base installations.

| These usually need to be installed by users themselves.
| The following guides explain how to install software in user area:

Please note, you don't need to install 
:tt:`Python` / :tt:`R` / :tt:`Perl` / :tt:`conda` / :tt:`miniconda`, we
already have multiple versions of each software installed and they all are
accessible via modules.

Simply load Python/R/Perl/conda/miniconda  module  using command ``module avail`` 
(read :ref:`list modules` for details) to find out 
what particular software is already installed), then follow your package 
installation instructions. 

.. note:: | There are a few important initial installation steps that are unique to the HPC3.
          | They are explained in the guides below.
