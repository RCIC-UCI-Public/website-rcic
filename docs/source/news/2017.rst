:blogauthor:`2017-10-10 by Allen Schiano`

The UCI Research Cyberinfrastructure Center has been accepted as a member of the 
nation-wide Coalition for Academic Computing (CASC). 

As described in the CASC website (casc.org):
  Founded in 1989, the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC) is an 
  educational nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization with 86 member institutions 
  representing many of the nation's most forward thinking universities and computing centers.
  CASC is dedicated to advocating the use of the most advanced computing technology to 
  accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and 
  economic success, as well as develop a diverse and well-prepared 21st century workforce.

CASC's mission parallels the RCIC's mission:
  * disseminate information about the value of high performance computing and advanced communications technologies
  * provide an *expert resource* for the Executive Office of the President, the Congress, and government agencies
  * facilitate information exchange within the academic scientific computation and communication community

UCI joins UCLA, UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 
and UCSD's San Diego Supercomputing Center as UC members of this prestigious nationwide group.
