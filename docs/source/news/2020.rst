:blogtitle:`HPC3 Production and HPC Shutdown on 5 Jan 2021`

:blogauthor:`2020-11-04 by Philip Papadopoulos`

| We are pleased to announce that :ref:`hpc3` is in  *production*.
| All existing HPC users have accounts on HPC3 and can get started right away.
| A short presentation `HPC3 for HPC users  </_static/HPC3_for_HPC_Users.pdf>`_
  answers some of the key questions up front.

.. attention:: 
  
   The existing HPC cluster will run until 5 Jan 2021. 

   On that day, RCIC will shut down the queuing system, kill all
   running jobs and begin the process of physically dismantling HPC, moving some hardware to HPC3, and starting the
   transition of selected *mid-life* nodes for a cluster called HPC2.

   | Users should begin their transition to HPC3 now.
   | Please note that any files in your current HPC home area will be discarded sometime in January.

:blogtitle:`HPC3 Production Ramp Up`

:blogauthor:`2020-07-15 by Philip Papadopoulos`

We are pleased to announce that :ref:`hpc3` will enter its *production ramp up*
on 20 July 2020. A short presentation `Production Ramp-up </_static/Production_Ramp_Up.pdf>`_ 
describes this phase of HPC3.

To handle the transition of a large number of users to HPC3 during the ramp up, we're asking that research
groups/labs submit a single request to hpc-support@uci.edu (please see the presentation of what to include).

| Friendly users on HPC3 have consumed over 1 million core hours on 1+ million jobs.
| We expect the production ramp up to last about two months.
