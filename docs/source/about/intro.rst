Introduction
============

The Research Cyberinfrastructure Center :term:`RCIC` at the University of California, Irvine
deploys and supports resources for the UCI research community is the focal point of contact
for providing High Performance Computing clusters and Scalable Storage Systems.
The :ref:`allocations` explains the access to the computing and storage resources,
which include:

**Computing Cluster**
  :ref:`HPC3 <hpc3>`
    A scalable cluster-based computing infrastructure, UCI's next generation of
    shared computing supporting a *condo* and *pay-per-cycle* models.

**Storage Systems for storing and analyzing research data**:
  :ref:`crsp`
    Campus Research Storage Pool. Highly-reliable, encrypted-at-rest, scalable data
    storage system available across the UCI campus network.

  :ref:`dfs`
    Cluster Parallel File Storage System  is high-quality/high-performance data
    storage directly attached to HPC3.

**On-boarding to specialized compliant resources**
  These are used for data that can not be appropriately stored/analyzed on RCIC resources.

  `Sherlock <https://sherlock.sdsc.edu/>`_
    is SDSC's **DOD-compliant**, **HIPAA-Compliant** secure computing and storage enclave.

  `Secure Research Environment (SRE) <https://www.oit.uci.edu/services/security/sre/>`_
    is OIT's service that provides a secure, on-campus virtual server infrastructure for the UCI campus research community.

:ref:`dedicated staff` provides hardware and software support to the campus research community.
