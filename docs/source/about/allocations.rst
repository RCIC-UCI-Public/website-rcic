.. _allocations:

Allocations
===========

RCIC resources are funded and operated under a `shared financial model of
no-cost and recharge (pi-funded) allocations`.
UCI researchers  can have two types of allocations: :ref:`no-cost allocations` 
and :ref:`recharge allocations`.


**Faculty**
  - :ref:`no-cost allocations`: UCI researchers [#]_ may request no-cost allocations to baseline levels of:

    1. **Computing cycles** - 
       Computing cycles are  refilled (re-allocated) on a semi-annual 
       (every 6 months). Re-allocation is based upon a labâ€™s previous
       6 month utilization and available hours on UCI-purchased hardware. 
    2. **Campus Research Storage** (:term:`CRSP`) - 1TB per researcher.

  - :ref:`recharge allocations`:  when the baseline is insufficient for a particular lab,
    researchers can purchase additional capacity using grant or other funds. The recharge
    (pi-funded) allocations are available for :ref:`buy computing`, :ref:`buy crsp` and
    :ref:`buy dfs`.

  .. note:: **Faculty allocations are PI-centered** but the owners can  grant
            access to their allocations to students, postdocs, and other faculty members.

            :red:`Allocations can not be combined into larger group or center accounts.`

**Every user**
  - :ref:`no-cost allocations` ``one time 1000 core-hour allocation``. This SLURM allocation
    provides baseline level of computing cycles and is required to allow 
    users to access the `free` queues. It enables users who are not affiliated with 
    any research program to have meaningful access to HPC3. 
    Most users should use lab accounts instead of this one-time allocation.

.. _no-cost allocations:

No-cost
-------

In general, the cost of administration of RCIC resources is covered in RCIC's annual budget. 
RCIC is funded through central campus to provide a baseline allocations of centralized, research computing
and data services.

.. _recharge allocations:

Recharge
--------

When research program needs exceed this baseline, additional capacity can be purchased through recharge. 
It should be noted, that rates apply only to UCI researchers (faculty, research faculty, research staff).

The recharge tables below provides more details on costs and commitment.
Proposed rates for CRSP and CPU/GPU hours are in the process of being approved by the UCI recharge
rate review process. TODO (leave?) These have not been finalized.

.. _buy allocation:

How to buy allocations 
----------------------

The recharge is billed annually via campus recharge and is computed on the basis of
recovering the cost of additional space (for CRSP and DFS storage). These campus funds pay for the people, the
baseline infrastructure, and vendor maintenance required to provide the robust infrastructure.

All allocation purchase requests need to be emailed by a PI to hpc-support@uci.edu telling us
what allocations are desired. Please see sections below for details. 

.. _buy computing:

Computing
^^^^^^^^^

| Computing allocation for *accounted jobs*  can be expanded through:
|   1. :ref:`buy core-hours` from RCIC.
|   2. :ref:`buy hardware`  that is placed into the cluster and converted into core-hours.

.. _buy core-hours:

Purchase core-hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Please send a request to hpc-support@uci.edu telling us:
|   1. Type of core-hours (CPU or GPU)
|   2. How many core-hours you need

Core-hour purchases a done through an MOU on a ``prepaid card basis``. 
RCIC does not post-bill for core hours and it is not possible to be surprised 
with a large bill at the end of a month. 

Prepaid core hours are intended to be used within one calendar year.
Unused prepaid hours are forfeit after 18 months. The current :ref:`recharge hours`
rates are computed to recover the cost of hardware over a 5 year period at 60% use.

.. _buy hardware:

Purchase hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:bluelight:`Hardware that you purchase is converted to core-hours allocation.`
  | **The conversion rate is 95% of the theoretical core hours your hardware could deliver in a year**.
  | For example, a 40-core node can deliver:
  |         8760 hours/year * 40 cores = 350,400 core hours/year
  |         At 95% this would become a 332880 core-hour credit

  The 95% factor accounts accounts for usual annual downtime through scheduled 
  and unscheduled maintenance.  The 50% of this credit is applied during the 
  6 month reallocation each year the node is in the cluster (warranty period + year)

:bluelight:`Purchasing of nodes in HPC3 does NOT give you a "private" queue`.
  This means that some of your jobs may have to wait for resources, but it also gives
  you non-preempt access a larger number of cores than purchased.  In the first
  1.5 years of HPC3 operation, owners rarely wait for long periods of time.

:bluelight:`Hardware purchase process`
  Hardware is purchased through RCIC and can be requested at any time.
  When a large enough number of nodes have been requested
  (at least 4 CPU nodes and/or 1 GPU node), RCIC will obtain quote(s)
  from vendors for acceptable hardware.  Your source of funds (grant
  or other) is used to fund your share of the purchase. You can only
  purchase whole nodes, but you may use multiple sources of funds. In this
  model, we easily support two different faculty splitting the cost of a single node.

  | Hardware is commodity-based and subject to market variability, prices per 2022:
  |     CPU nodes (48 cores) are approximately $10K.
  |     GPU-nodes (4 x NVidia A30) are approximately $35K.

:bluelight:`Outline of Purchase Process`
  1. Send a request to hpc-support@uci.edu indicating your interest in purchasing
     nodes (CPU or GPU and how many) and time frame.
  2. RCIC obtains quotes once enough requests have been aggregated.
  3. Upon your approval purchase is made and your funds are used at purchase time.
  4. $1000/node one-time integration fee is re-charged AFTER the hardware has arrived.

.. warning:: You may not purchase hardware, send to the machine room, and then 
             expect RCIC to integrate this hardware into HPC3. Any hardware 
             purchased outside of the above process will not be integrated into HPC3
             nor will it be managed by RCIC.

Please see :ref:`hardware faq` for additional info about hardware purchases. 

.. _buy crsp:

CRSP storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Please send a request to hpc-support@uci.edu telling us
|   1. How much CRSP space you need (TB)
|   2. For how long (years)

We will create an MOU and sent to the PI for signing and will ask for a recharge index.
Once a PI signs an MOU for the desired amount of storage, the allocation is created
on the CRSP system.

.. _buy dfs:

DFS storage
^^^^^^^^^^^

| Please send a request to hpc-support@uci.edu telling us
|   1. How much DFS space you need (TB)
|   2. For how long (years)

We will create an MOU and sent to the PI for signing and will ask for a recharge index.
Once a PI signs an MOU for the desired amount of storage, the allocation is created
on one of the DFS systems.


.. [#] Ladder-rank faculty and any person who can serve as PI or Co-PI in extramural grants
.. [#] Max allocation as `available` hours to be used during the next 6 month
       interval. Allocation is adjusted dependent on actual use of core-hours.  Applies to faculty accounts.
.. [#] Because of limited physical resources, PI must specifically request allocation for GPU-hours.
       Applies to faculty accounts. 
.. [#] When a user no longer has an active UCINetID, files are removed.
