Allocations 
============


Baseline
--------

FROM hpc3/hpc3-expansion

UCI has purchased both CPU and GPU nodes hardware as part of HPC3.
Annual funds are used to add to this resource enabling RCIC to 
provide no-cost allocations to a larger fraction of the UCI research community.

1. **Faculty** may request a `no-cost allocation`. These accounts are refilled
   (re-allocated) on a semi-annual (every 6 months). Re-allocation is based upon a labâ€™s 
   previous 6 month utilization and available hours on UCI-purchased hardware. 
   Faculty allocations may be shared with anyone but may not be combined into larger 
   group or "center" accounts.

2. **Every user** is given a **one-time 1000 core hour allocation**. 
   A SLURM allocation is required to allow users to access the *free* queues and this 
   enables users who are not affiliated with any research program to have meaningful
   access to HPC3. Most users should use lab accounts instead of this one-time allocation.



No-cost 
--------

RCIC is funded through central campus to provide a baseline of centralized, 
research computing and data services. The following table summarizes the no-cost
allocations for campus researchers. The recharge table provides more details on costs.

When the baseline is insufficient for a particular lab, researchers can purchase additional 
capacity using grant or other funds.
