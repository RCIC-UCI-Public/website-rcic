HPC3 
====

Overview
---------

The HPC3 planning committee crafted policy guidelines to meet the following goals:

- Enable access to a larger compute/analysis system than could be reasonably afforded on an individual lab basis
- Enable access to specialized nodes (e.g. large memory, GPU)
- Foster a growing community across UCI to use scalable computing (HPC and HTC) for their scientific research and teaching
- Provide a well-managed software environment that underpins a reproducible scientific instrument. 
  Fit seamlessly into the progression of: desktop → lab cluster → campus → national and commercial cloud
- Enable construction of more-secure research environments


Specs
-----

HPC3 (specs, nodes/owners) is one of UCI’s shared-computing cluster that expands upon the condo-style model 
of GreenPlanet and the now-retired HPC clusters. Condo clusters have one model of expanding capacity — 
users purchase physical hardware. HPC3 supports expansion through hardware support but adds additional 
mechanisms to provide allocated capacity
